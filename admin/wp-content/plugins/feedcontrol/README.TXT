Feed Control v1.0 - Allows you to control the feeds that your site generates
Copyright (C) 2006 Christopher Hwang (email: chris@silpstream.com)

Introduction
------------
I wrote this plugin because I decided to create some Pages in WordPress for my site, but it wasn't until later that I realised that Pages are not included in the main feeds that WordPress generates when an update service tries to get the feeds from my site.

This plugin will allow you to change how WordPress generates the main feeds that the update services use. From here you can add Pages to your feeds or remove posts from them. You also have the option to exclude specific posts or pages based on their ID and can also set the sort options to use modified date instead of post date.

If you are feeling generous after trying this plugin out, please support my efforts through the donate link you see on my site at http://www.silpstream.com/blog/. I've been cracking the code out on my free time, so even a small token amount is appreciated.

Hope you find this useful. Let me know if you have any problems or have suggestions for improving it! Thanks!
